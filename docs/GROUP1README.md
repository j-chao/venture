## Implementation Contributions  
- Justin Chao     
    * implemented Firebase SDK
    * constructed Firebase Authentication and Database
    * created Launch, Login, Registration, Reset Password, Settings, Trip, Itinerary views and segues     
    * implemented change email/password, logout, delete account functions in Settings View    


- Julianne Crea   
*   


- Connie Liu   
    * implemented keyboard dismissal in all views
    * added constraints to background images throughout app
    * some of the UI elements in the itinerary view


## Grading Level   
- Same grade for all members  


## Differences  
- Itinerary
    * User is currently able to create new trips, view trip details, and access the add an event page via the pencil icon, but not actually add the event to the daily itinerary page because event location requires a map APK (Google Maps)
    * Other icons included in the daily itinerary view are just dummy icons that are not associated with an action yet because it requires the pull food/places/transportation features to be released in later versions.
- Configuration/Settings
    * User is currently able to change email and password or delete their account. User is not yet able to change the background throughout the app or switch between day/night mode because it would be easier to implement this function after all views have been made.

## Special Instructions   
- requires CocoaPods version 1.0.0 or later
- requires Xcode 7.0 or later
- requires iOS 7 or later
