## Grading Level   
- Same grade for all members  


## Differences  
- Itinerary
    * User is currently able to create new trips, view trip details, and access the "Add Event"
      view via the pencil icon. Due to time constraints, the ability to add an event to the
itinerary has not yet been implemented through the back-end Firebase database.

    * Other icons included in the daily itinerary view are just dummy icons that are not associated
      with an action yet because it requires the pull food/places/transportation features to be
released in later versions.  

- Configuration/Settings  
    * User is currently able to change their email and password (or add email/password if they
      logged in initially using Facebook), logout, or delete their account. User is not yet able to
change the background throughout the app or switch between day/night mode due to time constraints in
implementing this functionality in the alpha release.
